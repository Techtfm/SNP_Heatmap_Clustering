# SNP_Heatmap_Clustering
An R script for generating a clustered heatmap of SNP distance matrices using `pheatmap`. It reads SNP data from a CSV file, applies hierarchical clustering (Wardâ€™s method), and visualizes genetic variations with a grayscale color gradient. Ideal for researchers analyzing SNP patterns.
